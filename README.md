# GPT-SpaceBot
For every AI and space-passionate person :sunglasses:
This project includes a Web page integrating a chatGPT with the role of Space Scientist to convey conversations about space, earth, and the solar system. :space_invader: 
This is a simple project to practice GPT integration using OpenAI API and prompt engineering skills besides some website-building capabilities.

:triangular_flag_on_post: In order to make the chatbot work, you have to REPLACE the value of "API_KEY" in the script.js file with your own GPT API Key. :triangular_flag_on_post:


Thank you, and I hope it will be a beneficial project for you all! 	:wink:
